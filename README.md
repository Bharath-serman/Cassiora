# Welcome to Spideo

This is your personalized coding streak and DSA prep app. Make it your own!

**Use the Web App**

Open the app in your browser and start solving coding questions, tracking your streaks, and using the built-in notepad for your notes.

All your changes and progress are saved automatically.

**Use your preferred IDE**

You can also work locally using your favorite editor. Clone the repo, make changes, and push them to your own GitHub repository.

You'll need Node.js & npm installed. [Get Node.js here.](https://nodejs.org/)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev

# Step 5: Start the backend server.
node server.js

# Step 6: Start the compiler service.
cd compiler-service
npm start
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
