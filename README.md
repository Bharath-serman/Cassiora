# Welcome to Cassiora

This is your personalized coding streak and Placement prep app. Make it your own!

**Use the Web App**

Open the app in your browser and start solving coding questions, tracking your streaks, and using the built-in notepad for your notes.

All your changes and progress are saved automatically.

**Use your preferred IDE**

You can also work locally using your favorite editor. Clone the repo, make changes, and push them to your own GitHub repository.

You'll need Node.js & npm installed. [Get Node.js here.](https://nodejs.org/)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone https://github.com/Bharath-serman/Cassiora.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd Cassiora

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm install

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev

# Step 5: Start the backend server.
node server.js

# Step 6: Start the compiler service.
cd compiler-service
npm start
```

To run we need three cmd terminals :

1. npm run dev (Frontend)
2. cd compiler-service -> npm start (For coding compilers)
3. node server.js (For backend (MongoDB))
